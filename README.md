# dstask

A personal task tracker designed to help you focus.

Features:

 * Powerful context system
 * Git powered sync (passwordstore.org style)

Non-features:

 * Collaboration. This is a personal task tracker. Use another system for
   projects that involve multiple people. Note that it can still be beneficial
   to use dstask to track what you are working on in the context of a
   multi-person project tracked elsewhere.
